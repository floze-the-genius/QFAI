/**
 * Integration: the unresolvable-packaged-copy SKIP of the installed
 * shipped-workflow drift check (`qfai doctor`).
 *
 * TC-0006-0030 leg (c) — Setup 「install 済み package 側の shipped copy を解決でき
 * ない tree」, Verify 「check が severity `info` で skip し、drift として報告しな
 * い」 — which is BR-0006-0020's closing clause (「package 同梱 copy を解決できない
 * 場合は severity `info` で skip する」) under AC-0006-0023. The other two legs are
 * ledger rows, not gaps: leg (a) is TDD-0032's repair-text suite, and leg (b)
 * divides between TDD-0038 (the entry-LESS half) and the drift suite's second
 * `it` (the entry-BEARING one).
 *
 * ## Why the packaged resolver is MOCKED here
 *
 * `getInitAssetsDir` resolves two candidates relative to `import.meta.url` and
 * returns the first that exists (`src/shared/assets.ts:5-19`). It reads neither
 * the adopter root, nor the cwd, nor any environment variable, so — scoped to
 * that resolver as written — NO STATE OF THE FIXTURE TREE CAN MAKE IT THROW.
 * Real unresolvability is a broken or partial install of the package the suite is
 * running FROM, and arranging it for real means deleting the packaged assets out
 * from under every other suite in the same run. The mock is the seam, and the
 * argument has already bought one in this repository:
 * `tests/core/specLayoutCaseExact.test.ts` fakes `fs.access` for the states its
 * host filesystem cannot produce, and says so in the same place.
 *
 * SCOPED, because a module mock is a whole-file instrument:
 *
 * - the fake is keyed on a toggle that stays OFF while the adopter tree is
 *   seeded. `runInit` reaches the same module (`src/cli/lib/assets.ts:1`
 *   re-exports it) and with the toggle open would have no template to copy;
 * - `afterEach` resets it, so a failing assertion cannot leak the open toggle
 *   into a later test in this file;
 * - the reader reaches the mock because it imports the resolver from exactly
 *   this module (`src/core/doctor/workflowsIntegrity.ts:94`), not because the
 *   mock is global.
 *
 * WHAT ELSE THE OPEN TOGGLE MOVES, named rather than left to be discovered: the
 * skills-integrity check reads the same resolver and catches its throw into
 * `skipped_missing_assets` (`src/core/skillsIntegrity.ts:48-58`), which
 * `doctor.ts` emits as an `info` skip of its own. The mocked window therefore
 * models a broken install for BOTH integrity checks at once — which is the state
 * this leg describes rather than a distortion of it — and it is why every
 * assertion below filters on the `workflows.integrity` id instead of counting or
 * sweeping the whole `checks` array.
 *
 * Observed through `createDoctorData`, matching all three sibling suites: the
 * severity and the payload are decided at the registration site, so a skip the
 * reader reports but nobody registers must fail here rather than pass on the
 * reader. The reader is read too, but only in the guards.
 *
 * This file grows row by row; each describe block is one ledger row. The
 * round-by-round derivation — mutations as needle text, blobs, outputs — is in
 * `.qfai/evidence/implement-spec-0006.md`.

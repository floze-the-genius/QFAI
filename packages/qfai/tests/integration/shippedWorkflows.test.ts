/**
 * Integration: shipped GitHub Actions workflow-set bounding and credential
 * hygiene.
 *
 * Covers the operational-bounding half of the shipped-workflows contract
 * (`.qfai/contracts/cli/shipped-workflows.md`, CLI-WFSET §5 dimension 3 and
 * §6): every shipped job is bounded (reachable least-privilege
 * `permissions:` block, `timeout-minutes:`) and every shipped workflow
 * cancels superseded runs via a ref-scoped `concurrency:` group. The
 * shipped/retired name lists' disjointness invariant (the write/prune sets
 * can never claim the same name) is asserted here as well — its ruled home
 * per the shape-guard scope of this suite. The lockfile-aware install
 * path's survival through the hardening (five branches, nested cache
 * ternary, engines-backed header floor claims) is the third describe's
 * surface.
 *
 * This file grows row by row; each describe block is one ledger row.

/**
 * Integration: the shipped GitHub Actions workflow-set structural contract
 * gate.
 *
 * Covers the gate half of the shipped-workflows contract
 * (`.qfai/contracts/cli/shipped-workflows.md`, CLI-WFSET §5): ONE declared
 * shape, whose values live in exactly one module (`shippedWorkflowShape.ts`
 * beside this file), diffed against a workflow tree and reporting
 * `R-SHIPPED-WORKFLOW-SHAPE-DRIFT` with the drifted value and the expected
 * one. The gate's operand is a TREE, so every plant below lands on a temp
 * COPY of the shipped set — the packaged assets are never mutated.
 *
 * Relationship to the sibling shipped-workflow suites, disclosed: each of
 * them owns the DEEP oracle for one property — runner-selector indirection
 * and header-table completeness (`shippedWorkflowRunners`), bounding and
 * credential hygiene (`shippedWorkflows`), SHA pins and leakage-guard breadth
 * (`shippedWorkflowPins`), cross-file references and the `.github`
 * child allow-list (`shippedWorkflowTopology`), lane inertness evaluated as a
 * condition (`shippedWorkflowInertness`), change detection and verdict
 * (`shippedWorkflowDetection`), portability of the setup/install column
 * (`shippedWorkflowPortability`) and the ownership / provenance flow
 * (`shippedWorkflowOwnership`). This file owns the DECLARED SHAPE and its
 * diff — that all nine contract dimensions are pinned in one place, and that
 * each one is actually diffed rather than merely declared. It re-implements
 * no sibling oracle and contradicts none.
 *
 * This file grows row by row; each describe block is one ledger row.

  // TC-0003-0051). The TC says to run `pnpm ci:lint` planted and clean. That

  // would have to mutate the REAL distributed assets, which no suite may do,
  // and (b) the aggregate is a minutes-long chain of unrelated lanes, so its
  // exit code would not be this gate's exit code. The adopted shape drives
  // `diffShippedWorkflowShape()` directly over planted temp copies and clean
  // trees, and realizes "exit 1" as the gate's own verdict assertion failing
  // (`assertShapeGateAccepts` above) — the substitute proves a STRONGER fact
  // than the literal Action: it names which dimension diverged, with the
  // expected and the drifted value, instead of only a non-zero status. The
  // static `pnpm ci:lint` placement pin (and the wiring itself) is TDD-0050's
  // row; nothing here asserts the lane registry.
  //
  // RULINGS APPLIED, disclosed because they decide what the shape may say:
  // - Dimension 6 ("what makes each lane inert") accepts "never inert;
  //   deletion is the opt-out" as a LEGAL value. The validate lane's header
  //   answers exactly that and TDD-0042 shipped it, so a shape that demanded
  //   an opt-in condition from every lane would read the shipped set as
  //   violating its own contract. it2's clean acceptance is where that holds,
  //   and it3's per-file coverage is what stops the shape from ducking the
  //   question by omitting the file.
  // - Dimension 5 has NO subject in the orchestrator: its five lanes are echo
  //   placeholders and invoke no QFAI subcommand. The shape says so instead of
  //   inventing values, which is again it3's per-file coverage.
  //
  // SUBSUMED HERE (DTC-26), with the moved assertions' test-case reference
  // registered on this row: the ad-hoc dimension-5 string assertions that used
  // to sit in `tests/assets/assets.test.ts` and `tests/cli/init.test.ts` —

  // tree" — now have exactly one oracle, the declared shape's dimension-5 pins.

  // literal, which is why it4's scan is tree-wide. The reference is registered

/**
 * Integration: shipped setup-install portability and its two degrade
 * directions.
 *
 * Covers the portability half of the shipped-workflows contract
 * (`.qfai/contracts/cli/shipped-workflows.md`, CLI-WFSET §5 dimension 2 and
 * §6): the shipped setup-install column resolves the adopter's Node version
 * and the adopter's package manager from the adopter's own tree, and the two
 * resolutions degrade in OPPOSITE directions — an absent Node version file
 * falls OPEN to the documented literal with a warning annotation and the
 * lane continues, while an unresolvable package-manager version fails CLOSED
 * with an annotation naming the manifest field to fix. Both resolutions live
 * in extractable `run:` bodies precisely so they are observable off-runner:
 * they are extracted from the REAL packaged shipped tree and executed with
 * bash (`-e -o pipefail`, the flags GitHub applies to `shell: bash` steps on
 * hosted runners) against adopter fixture trees in temp directories.
 *
 * This file grows row by row; each describe block is one ledger row.

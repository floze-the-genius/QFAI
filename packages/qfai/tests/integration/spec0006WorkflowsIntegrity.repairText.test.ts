/**
 * Integration: the repair text carried by the installed shipped-workflow drift
 * advisory (`qfai doctor`).
 *
 * The oracle is the four "Required message content" items of
 * `.qfai/contracts/cli/qfai-doctor.md`'s `workflows.integrity` section, each
 * restated at its own labelled assertion below. THE PRIMARY ORACLE IS EXACT
 * EQUALITY on the whole MESSAGE, composed test-side; the three named needles
 * survive it as labelled restatements. Requirement 1 belongs to the sibling
 * drift suite, but the pin SUBSUMES it, so a change to that clause reddens both
 * rows — accepted: one message, one emission site.
 *
 * Leg (a) of TC-0006-0030 only; the other legs are ledger rows, not gaps. Leg
 * (b) (an absent shipped name is not drift) divides by the record — TDD-0038
 * takes the entry-LESS half, the sibling drift suite's second `it` the
 * entry-BEARING (`declined`) one — and leg (c) (an unresolvable packaged copy
 * skips at `info`) is TDD-0039's.
 *
 * TWO NEEDLE RULES, cited by number below:
 *   1. A NEEDLE SPANNING MORE THAN ONE WORD MUST BOUND ITS GAPS IN WORDS
 *      (`(?:\s+\w+){0,N}\s+`), NEVER IN CHARACTERS.
 *   2. IT MUST BIND EVERY OPERAND THE REQUIREMENT NAMES — subject as well as
 *      verb, object as well as instrument.
 * A positive needle fails RED when over-tight, a negative sweep when
 * over-broad; which side an oracle sits on decides how tight to make it.
 *
 * Observed through `createDoctorData`, matching both sibling suites: the message
 * is composed at the registration site, so the reader cannot see it. Each
 * describe block is one ledger row; the round-by-round derivation — witnesses,
 * measurements, mutant blobs — is in `.qfai/evidence/implement-spec-0006.md`.

 * Tokens whose presence in the advisory would make it name a command.
 *
 * The bare string `qfai` is deliberately NOT a member, and that omission is
 * load-bearing rather than lax: requirement 2 puts the packaged source path
 * into the message, and in any real install that path runs through
 * `node_modules/qfai/…`, so a `not.toContain("qfai")` oracle would fail on a
 * message that satisfies the contract.
 *
 * `assets/init` is the SAME HAZARD ONE LEVEL DEEPER, and it is the one that
 * matters most here: the packaged path is rooted at `getInitAssetsDir()`, so
 * every message renders `…/assets/init/root/.github/workflows` and a bare
 * `/\binit\b/i` token is PERMANENTLY UNAVAILABLE — not merely inconvenient.
 * `init` is also the subcommand an adopter is most likely to be told to re-run,
 * so the token that cannot be written naively is exactly the token the contract
 * most needs. Token 8 resolves it with a separator LOOKBEHIND, never a
 * lookahead: a path occurrence is always PRECEDED by `/`, `\`, `@`, `.` or `-`
 * (`…/assets/init/root`, `qfai-validate.yml`), an imperative never is. Its
 * lookahead deliberately does NOT exempt `.`, which is the fix rather than an
 * oversight — see the token's own note below. Measured clean on the Windows
 * path, the POSIX path, `qfai-validate.yml` and the pnpm store form
 * (`node_modules/.pnpm/qfai@1.9.0/node_modules/qfai/assets/init/root`); measured
 * FIRING on `re-run init to restore it` and `re-run init.` (tokens 7 AND 8) and
 * on `To repair, validate.` and `If you prefer, init the tree again.` (token 8
 * alone, which is what earns it its place beside token 7).
 *
 * The other tokens are anchored so that a path SEGMENT BOUNDARY cannot satisfy
 * them — `\s` after `qfai`, a word boundary for the package managers, leading
 * whitespace before a flag. That is narrower than "a path cannot satisfy them",
 * which is false and was measured to be false: a checkout path containing a
 * SPACE fires token 1. An over-fire only, in the FALSE-RED direction, and
 * invisible in CI, which runs a space-free checkout path. The derivation is in
 * the evidence file rather than here.
 *
 * The first token over-approximates the contract's "no imperative naming a
 * `qfai` subcommand": it also matches ordinary prose such as "QFAI will not
 * overwrite it". That over-approximation is kept on purpose. In a NEGATIVE
 * assertion an over-broad needle can only produce a false RED, never a false
 * GREEN, so tightening it could admit a violation while loosening the prose
 * cannot. The cost is that the message must not put a word straight after the
 * product name; it says "… by QFAI:" instead, and that is measured, not
 * assumed — see the token sweep at the assertion below, whose failure label
 * names this false positive because the label alone would misdescribe it.

  // ONE AssertionError this token's, pin and requirements 2 and 3 GREEN — a LONE
  // FALSE RED, on text still meeting all four items (`report` a bare NOUN there).
  //
  // WHICH IS WHAT THE CONSTRAINT COSTS — one argument with the above, not a bound

      // The pin says nothing about `title` or `details`, AND NEITHER IS SWEPT HERE.
      // TC-0006-0030 clause (a), BR-0006-0020 and the contract's "Required message
      // content" all scope requirement 4 to the message BODY, so an assertion over
      // the other rendered fields is a reviewer-originated obligation — recorded as
      // advisory and routed to the Change Request path, never encoded as a hard
      // assertion. One was carried here for three rounds and removed on

      // `qfai<TAB>report` passes this row whole. Contract widening is routed
      // upstream; nothing here waits on it.
      //
      // WHAT THAT LEAVES, split by OWNER rather than by mechanism:
      //   - `details` is BR-0006-0022's closed four-key payload, TDD-0036's to pin.
      //     Every constructible violation needs an EXTRA key — `nextActions: ["qfai
      //     init --force"]`, the shape `skills.integrity` actually ships, and its
      //     tab-escaped form `["qfai\tinit\t--force"]` alike — so a `toEqual` on the
      //     key set closes the whole class INCLUDING the escaped forms, which no
      //     whitespace-anchored needle can see (`JSON.stringify` writes a backslash
      //     then `t`; `\n` and `\r\n` behave identically — measured). TDD-0036 is
      //     `todo`, so the class is UNCOVERED IN THE INTERVAL: deliberate, and with
      //     a named owner rather than a silent gap.
      //   - `title` is UNOWNED, and naming that is the point of this note. A tab
      //     inside its VALUE carries a command with no key-set change, so TDD-0036's
      //     `toEqual` will not reach it either and no key-set pin can. It is outside
      //     the contract as written, which is why it is recorded and raised upstream
      //     instead of asserted.

      //
      // The three anchors, each with the witness it closes:
      //   - `(?:^|[^\w\s]\s+)` before `replace` — the verb must OPEN its clause,

      //     of a verb necessarily puts a word in front of it ("do NOT replace",
      //     "nothing will replace", "we never replace"), so this is a STRUCTURAL
      //     sufficient condition for the verb being asserted, needing no
      //     negator vocabulary to maintain.
      //   - `(?:listed|stale|drifted)` between the verb and `with` — the object
      //     must refer back to the enumeration in the first sentence. Closes
      //     `replace your local backup with …`, which is directionally correct
      //     and sends the operator at the wrong file.
      //   - `\s+` immediately before the path — see the anchor note below.
      //
      // The `\s+` immediately before the path is the ANTI-RELATIVIZATION ANCHOR
      // and it is load-bearing on POSIX specifically. `toContain(packagedDir)`
      // was GREEN on ubuntu — all seven `ci.yml` `runs-on` values are
      // `ubuntu-latest` — for a `toRelativePath(root, packagedDir)` tidy-up at
      // the emission site, because `toRelativePath` has no absolute fallback
      // (`src/core/paths.ts`) and the `../..` chain CONTAINS the absolute
      // target: the last `../` supplies the leading `/`.
      //
      // On Windows the same edit reddens twice over (`C:` and backslashes). The
      // relationship between the anchor and the gap is NOT independence. Three
      // variants against the relativized message — the Windows column EXECUTED, the
      // POSIX column CONSTRUCTED, since this row cannot run ubuntu from this host:
      //
      //   `\s+` before the path            → RED on POSIX and Windows
      //   weakened to `\s*`                → RED on POSIX and Windows
      //   replaced by `[\s\S]{0,8}`        → **GREEN on POSIX**, red on Windows
      //
      // So the anchor is the LAST LINK OF THE WORD-BOUNDED CHAIN rather than a
      // second mechanism: what closes the relativization is that no gap in this
      // needle admits a non-word character, and `\s+` is where that property
      // meets the path. Weakening it to `\s*` is harmless; replacing it with any
      // character window reopens the exact ubuntu-only hole this row was reviewed
      // for. Do not "simplify" it in that direction. The measurement stays beside
      // the rule because a maintainer who reads "never bound a gap in characters"
      // has no reason to believe a character WINDOW is different in kind, and the
      // only lane that would catch it cannot show them.
      //
      // Two DRY edits a later reader will reach for, both of which must be
      // REFUSED, per the convention the sibling row set when it named the

/**
 * Integration: the provenance gate on the installed shipped-workflow drift
 * advisory (`qfai doctor`).
 *
 * The comparison set of `workflows.integrity` is the set of names the
 * `.qfai/install-provenance.json` record carries — never a filename pattern.
 * The reserved `qfai-` prefix is a reservation notice, not a selector
 * (`.qfai/contracts/cli/shipped-workflows.md` §1), so an adopter who authored
 * a colliding name first owns that file and it is `adopter-owned`: silent in
 * `qfai doctor`, forever (§3).
 *
 * What this file has to establish is that the silence is DERIVED, not vacuous.
 * A check that reported nothing at all would satisfy "the collision is not
 * named" just as well, so the collision and a live provenance-backed stale
 * file share one adopter tree here and the stale one is asserted to be
 * reported in the same run that stays silent about the collision.
 *
 * Observed through `createDoctorData` rather than the reader, matching the
 * sibling drift suite: a finding that is produced but never registered would
 * pass a reader-only test. One assertion in the second row below reads the
 * reader instead, and says why at its own line.
 *
 * Both of §3's entry-LESS states live here, one row each: `adopter-owned`
 * (no entry, file present) and `absent` (no entry, nothing on disk). What they
 * share is the observation that decides them — the name has no provenance
 * entry — which is this file's subject.
 *
 * This file grows row by row; each describe block is one ledger row.

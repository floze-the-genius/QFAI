/**
 * Integration: installed shipped-workflow drift advisory (`qfai doctor`).
 *
 * Covers the detection half of the adopter drift channel: an installed
 * shipped GitHub Actions workflow whose content no longer matches the copy
 * inside the installed package is surfaced by the `workflows.integrity`
 * check at severity `info`, naming the stale file by its adopter-tree
 * relative path. See `.qfai/contracts/cli/qfai-doctor.md`
 * (`workflows.integrity`) and `.qfai/contracts/cli/shipped-workflows.md`.
 *
 * The primary observation point is `createDoctorData` rather than the reader,
 * so a finding that is produced but never registered fails here instead of
 * passing invisibly. The one exception is the packaged-operand override leg,
 * which the registration site does not pass and which therefore has to be
 * observed on the reader itself; that is stated at the assertion.
 *
 * This file grows row by row; each describe block is one ledger row.

    // adding it — the licence is the closed state enum of
    // `.qfai/contracts/cli/shipped-workflows.md` §3, where a name with no
    // provenance entry is `adopter-owned` (present on disk) or `absent`, and
    // BOTH rows mandate silence from `qfai doctor`. The doctor contract states
    // the same thing twice: its emission table keys `ok` to `installed` alone,
    // and its non-goals say it reports nothing for a workflow with no
    // provenance entry.

    // with no recorded name there is no `installed` name either, so an `ok`
    // check would be claiming a match QFAI never looked for. This is also the

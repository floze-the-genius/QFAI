# 07 Decisions

Decision Records for this spec. A `DR-*` cited from the `DR-ID` column of
`tdd/test-list.md` — which every `exception` row is required to carry — resolves against this
file, so an entry here is what makes that citation checkable.

## ID scheme

- **Spec-scoped**: `DR-0017-NNNN`. Every entry below binds only `spec-0017`.
- **Policy-level**: `DR-0275` (revoke the permanent-gap reservation) and `DR-0276` (`toolchain`
  as a fifth slice category, with the distributed-or-not boundary) are declared in
  `_policies/08_Decisions.md` and recorded in `_policies/10_delta.md` § `2026-08-05 — CHG-007`.
  They are cited from here and deliberately not restated: an ID declared twice has two owners.

## Decisions

### DR-0017-0001: the size signal is a signal, not a SPLIT trigger

- Status: accepted
- Context: this spec is created carrying 34 acceptance criteria, and the downstream test-case
  count will exceed fifty. `_policies/11_Slice-Policy.md` § `APPEND vs CREATE 判定アルゴリズム`
  carries a size test of `acCount <= 30 && tcCount <= 50`, and its step 4 routes a
  capability-holding spec that exceeds the threshold to **SPLIT**. Read carelessly, this spec
  looks like it was born over the line.
- Decision: record the breach as a **signal only**, and hold `spec-0017` as one collective spec
  owning exactly `CAP-0017`. A count-driven SPLIT of this spec is illegal and must not be
  proposed by a later triage. Three independent reasons, each sufficient on its own:
  1. **The threshold gates allocation, not existence.** The size test is a step in the
     append-versus-create algorithm that decides _where a newly arriving requirement goes_. It
     is not a size cap on a spec. `spec-0017` arrived through an approved `CREATE` row
     (`user@2026-08-05`), not through an `APPEND`, so the threshold never gated its creation and
     cannot retroactively condemn it.
  2. **The SPLIT trigger's precondition is false here.** The trigger is "one spec holds several
     capabilities and needs its responsibilities separated". `spec-0017` holds exactly one
     capability. There is nothing to separate.
  3. **A SPLIT has no legal end state.** `validateSpecSplitByCapability` derives its expected
     spec set **positionally** from the capability count, mapping each capability's list index
     to the spec directory at that ordinal position. Splitting `spec-0017` into two directories
     would produce eighteen spec directories against seventeen capabilities and raise
     `QFAI-SPLIT-104` at `error`, while the second directory would hold no capability at all.
     There is no arrangement of a split that validates.
- Decision, second half: a future requirement arriving on `CAP-0017` is routed to
  **`UPDATE:APPEND`** with the size restated in its triage rationale, never to SPLIT. This is
  the same shape `DR-0276` licenses when it registers `toolchain` as a **collective** category —
  deliberately collective in the way `spec-0015` is collective for the agent surface, rather
  than accidentally oversized.
- Consequences: this spec will keep growing with QFAI's own toolchain, and the size signal will
  keep firing at every triage. That cost is accepted in exchange for not fragmenting one
  cohesive design across directories that no capability can name. The structural fix is not
  ours: `OQ-0023` tracks making the 1:1 gate pair capabilities to specs by **number** rather
  than by list position, which is what would let the "leave a gap" default stop being a trap.
  Until then, a reviewer seeing the breach should read this entry, not the threshold.

  `DR-0276`, `OQ-0023`, OC-71

### DR-0017-0002: partial observability is preserved rather than over-asserted

- Status: accepted
- Context: two requirements this spec owns are only partly observable, and the tempting
  correction in both cases is to invent an assertion the tree cannot support. The discussion
  pack marks both `partial` in its testability notes, and the acceptance criteria already
  reflect that. Recording why keeps a later author from "completing" them into a gate that
  either cannot exist or cannot fail.
- Decision, case one — **the action-pin bump owner (REQ-0003).** The pin _form_ is fully
  machine-checked: every reference resolves to a forty-hex SHA or the hygiene lane exits 1
  (BR-0017-0020). The _ownership_ half is not, and cannot be here: no automated bump
  configuration exists (OC-5) and creating one at the repository root requires explicit user
  approval (OC-3), so there is no file for a gate to read. The criterion is therefore written
  as an artifact-existence obligation — a durable repository artifact names the owner
  (AC-0017-0011, BR-0017-0022) — with the one substitute a reviewer would reach for explicitly
  refused: a bump owner stated only in a pull-request description does not satisfy it, because
  no gate can read a pull-request description. Inventing a machine check over a configuration
  that no agent may create would have made the requirement unsatisfiable rather than partial.
- Decision, case two — **build-artifact reuse (REQ-0005).** Its observable is a bundler
  invocation count compared against a captured baseline, and **that baseline does not exist
  yet**; capturing it is a precondition, not an assumption (NFR-0001). The requirement is
  therefore satisfied by **either** landing the reuse (AC-0017-0014) **or** recording a
  measurement that shows a wall-clock regression and keeping the rebuilds (AC-0017-0015). Both
  branches are accepting, which is what keeps the requirement falsifiable in both directions:
  it fails when a change lands with **no** captured numbers at all (BR-0017-0030), not when the
  numbers disagree with the hypothesis. A measured "no" is an outcome, not a failed attempt, so
  no retry-until-it-agrees loop is entered.
- Decision, and what is deliberately _not_ claimed as the same case: REQ-0008's cost partition
  and REQ-0010's final worker value are also incomplete today, but for a different reason —
  their inputs arrive later rather than being unobtainable. Both are already carried by
  measurement-gated criteria (AC-0017-0028, and the `should` priority on the layer-separation
  story), so neither needs a decision of its own. The distinction matters: case one is bounded
  by a policy that forbids the artifact, case two by a measurement that has not been taken.
- Consequences: two acceptance criteria are satisfiable by review plus an artifact rather than
  by an assertion, and one requirement has two accepting outcomes. A reviewer must therefore
  read the recorded evidence rather than only the exit code. The bump-owner half becomes
  machine-checkable the moment a user approves a bump configuration; that is the trigger to
  revisit this entry, and nothing else is.

### DR-0017-0003: the action-pin bump owner is recorded here, as a role

- Status: accepted
- Context: BR-0017-0022 makes the pins unsatisfied until a durable repository artifact names who
  bumps them, and offers two homes — this decision record, or a bump configuration. The
  configuration cannot be created without user approval (OC-3), so this record is the home that
  is available today. The repository declares no code-owner file, so there is no existing
  artifact a name could be resolved from.
- Decision: the bump owner for every action pin under `.github/workflows/**` and
  `.github/actions/**` is **the QFAI repository maintainer role that owns `CAP-0017`**, and the
  obligation is discharged as a step of **release preparation** — the same pass that syncs
  `packages/qfai/package.json#version` to the branch pin and renames the CHANGELOG heading. At
  each such pass the owner re-resolves every pinned SHA against its upstream tag and records the
  result in the pull-request description.
- Decision, and why a role rather than a person: a named individual recorded here would go stale
  with no gate able to notice, which is the same failure class the version-marker rules exist to
  prevent. Release preparation is chosen as the cadence because it is the only recurring moment
  in this repository that is already structurally detectable — the branch-name version pin makes
  it observable, so an owner attached to it cannot quietly lapse into "whenever someone
  remembers".
- Consequences: the pins are auditable by review at a known moment rather than continuously, and
  drift between two pull requests is possible and accepted. Binding the role to a named person
  or team, and any automated bump lane, both require the user; that residual is recorded in
  DR-0017-0002 rather than papered over here.

### DR-0017-0004: one script executes both the hygiene rule set and the required-context check

- Status: accepted
- Context: this spec introduces two assertions over the same input. The hygiene rule set
  (BR-0017-0037) parses every own workflow, and the required-context declaration check
  (BR-0017-0043) needs the job graph of every own workflow to decide whether the declared
  context resolves, is unskippable, and still carries its verification set.
- Decision: one repository script owns both. The hygiene script is the executor for the
  required-context declaration check, and the declaration is an input file it reads from the
  working tree. Two output sections, one exit code, one parse of the workflow tree.
- Decision, rejected alternative — a second, separate checker: a second parser over the same
  YAML is a second answer that drifts, and whichever runs first decides. This is the drift class
  the shipped-tree gate exists to close; reproducing it inside our own lane would be
  self-defeating.
- Decision, rejected alternative — a validator rule under `src/core/validators/**`: that surface
  belongs to `spec-0004` and ships to adopters. These checks are repository-internal and read a
  declaration only this repository has, so placing them there would put an undistributable
  obligation on a distributed surface and cross the boundary `DR-0276` fixes.
- Consequences: the script's rule set spans two concerns, so its output must name them
  separately (BR-0017-0038) or a green result becomes illegible. The script is also the single
  point of failure for both checks, which is why every rule carries its own positive and
  negative fixture (BR-0017-0039).

### DR-0017-0005: the merge order is part of the design, not of the plan

- Status: accepted
- Context: five obligations in this spec can be violated by **merge order alone**, with every
  file individually correct. A plan file states approach and is not a gate; a decision record is
  citable from a review. So the order is recorded here.
- Decision: the following edges are mandatory, and a pull request that inverts one is rejected in
  review regardless of its diff:
  1. The derived aggregate verdict (BR-0017-0001) merges **before** any change that adds a job
     (BR-0017-0005). Otherwise a job can be added to a gate that ignores it.
  2. The own-tree hardening — permissions, checkout flags, pins (BR-0017-0015, BR-0017-0018,
     BR-0017-0020) — merges **with or before** the hygiene lane that asserts it. A lane that
     precedes its own tree's hardening lands instantly red.
  3. The single setup definition (BR-0017-0024) merges **before** build-artifact reuse
     (BR-0017-0029). The dedup is what makes reuse a win rather than a trade, because it is what
     removes the per-job install the reuse would otherwise still pay.
  4. The shipped-set structural contract gate — `spec-0003`'s, not ours — merges **with or
     before** the duplicate validate workflow's deletion (BR-0017-0061).
  5. Shipped-tree hygiene coverage (BR-0017-0044) merges **with or after** the shipped
     hardening, never before it (BR-0017-0045).
- Decision, and one non-edge stated so it is not invented: the parallelism **structure**
  (BR-0017-0047, BR-0017-0048) does not wait on the measurement. Only the final value does
  (BR-0017-0049). Slice-surface alignment (BR-0017-0055 … BR-0017-0057) sits inside the same
  file, so it lands first or in the same change, and the layer-to-CI-lane mapping document
  (BR-0017-0062 … BR-0017-0066) has no ordering relationship to anything else here.
- Consequences: two of the five edges cross a spec boundary into `spec-0003`, so this spec
  cannot be completed independently of it. That coupling is real and is recorded rather than
  designed away — the alternative was to duplicate the shipped-set gate on this side, which
  `DR-0276` forbids.

### DR-0017-0006: the traceability ledger is activated with a promotion rule

- Status: accepted
- Context: `16_Traceability-ledger.md` is adopted in only three of sixteen existing specs, so
  `QFAI-TRACE-001` is skipped for the other thirteen and `QFAI-TRACE-002` degrades to a
  warning. That skip is how three spec-claimed implementation paths survived unnoticed —
  `packages/qfai/src/core/validators/findDesignMdViolations.ts`,
  `packages/qfai/src/core/validators/reviewerReport.ts` and
  `packages/qfai/scripts/lint-ssot-pair.ts` do not exist, and the real symbol lives at
  `packages/qfai/src/core/prototyping/designMdViolations.ts`. `OQ-0025` records that gap.
  Of the three adopting specs, only one is actually live: the other two present a first table
  whose rows the validator ignores or whose header shape it rejects.
- Decision: `spec-0017` carries a ledger from creation, and it is shaped so the integrity check
  is **active**: the first Markdown table uses the header the validator requires, so
  `QFAI-TRACE-002` does not fire and the check is not skipped.
- Decision: rows are **promoted**, not predicted. `QFAI-TRACE-001` is an `error` that compares
  each linked path against the same branch's diff, so a row naming a file that does not exist
  yet turns every later edit to `03_Acceptance-Criteria.md` or `04_Business-Rules.md` red. The
  first table therefore holds only rows whose implementation artifact exists **and** is touched
  by the change that authors the row; every other binding lives in a clearly labelled second
  table, which the ledger contract defines as prose and the validator provably ignores. A row
  moves from the second table to the first in the same change that creates its file.
- Decision, rejected alternative — omit the ledger until implementation begins: that is exactly
  the state `OQ-0025` shows is unsafe. The cost of omission is not "the check runs later", it is
  "the check is silently skipped and a phantom path is never contradicted".
- Decision, rejected alternative — list every planned path in the first table now and accept a
  red gate: that inverts the gate's meaning. It would fail on correct spec authoring and be
  routinely waived, which is how an `error` becomes noise.
- Consequences: the active table starts small and grows monotonically, so its size is a legible
  measure of how much of this spec is realized. Paths in the second table are unguarded until
  promoted, which is the residual this entry accepts; `10_Plan.md` marks every such path as
  to-be-created so the two files cannot disagree about which exist.
